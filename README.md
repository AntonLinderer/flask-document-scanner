# flask-document-scanner
## Setup
I tested this with Python 3. Create your environment and install the packages with `pip install`.

## Running
Run with `python server.py`
With Postman or Curl, send a POST request with form-data, "file" is the key and the value is your image.
As a response, you should get the scanned image.
